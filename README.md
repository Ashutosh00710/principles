This repository contains the principles that guide me in dealing with software engineering challenges.

### Why this repository?

I realized that many of the issues we face as engineers and in life are recurring, and having good principles to rely on can provide a consistent and guided way to approach problems. These principles are based on my experience developing software, and I will continue to develop and refine them as needed.
